\title{A package for estimating a mixed proportional hazard competing risk model with the NPMLE.}
\description{
The main method of the package is \code{\link{mphcrm}}. It has an interface
somewhat similar to \code{\link{lm}}.  There is an example of use in \code{\link{datagen}}, with
a generated dataset similiar to the ones in \cite{Gaure et al. (2007)}. For those who have
used the program used in that paper, a mixture of R, Fortran, C, and python,
this is an entirely new self-contained package, written from scratch with 12 years of experience.
Currently not all functionality from that behemoth has been implemented, but most of it.
}
\details{
The package may use more than one cpu, the default is taken from \code{getOption("durmod.threads")}
which is initialized from the environment variable \env{DURMOD_THREADS}, \env{OMP_THREAD_LIMIT},
\env{OMP_NUM_THREADS} or \env{NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS}, or parallel::detectCores() upon loading the package.

There is a vignette (\code{vignette("whatmph")}) with more details about \pkg{durmod}.
